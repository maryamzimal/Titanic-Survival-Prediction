# 🚢 Titanic Survivor Prediction – Data Analytics & ML Project.

This project applies **data analytics** and **machine learning** to the classic **Titanic dataset** to predict passenger survival based on features like **age**, **gender**, **class**, and **embarkation point**.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

**Data Cleaning:**  
Handled missing values, dropped irrelevant columns, and created new features (e.g., *FamilySize*).

**Visualization:**  
Explored survival patterns using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib** (by gender, class, and age).

**Feature Engineering:**  
Encoded categorical features and prepared data for modeling.

**Modeling:**  
Trained a **Random Forest Classifier** and evaluated it using **accuracy**, **confusion matrix**, and **classification report**.

**Prediction:**  
Generated final predictions and saved results as `titanic_predictions.csv`.
